# Statistical Analysis and Hypothesis Testing

## Overview

This project demonstrates various statistical tests and concepts using Python and relevant libraries like `scipy.stats` and `statsmodels`. It covers hypothesis testing, confidence intervals, Type I and Type II errors, statistical power, and sample size calculation.

## Concepts Covered

1. **Normality Test**: Shapiro-Wilk Test and Kolmogorov-Smirnov Test.
2. **Correlation Tests**: Pearson and Spearman's Rank Correlation.
3. **Parametric Tests**: T-test and ANOVA.
4. **Non-Parametric Tests**: Mann-Whitney U Test.
5. **Test of Stationarity**: Important for time series analysis.
6. **Two-Sample T-Test**: Investigates whether the means of two independent data samples differ.
7. **Paired T-Test**: Tests whether the means of paired samples differ.
8. **Statistical Power**: Calculates the sample size needed to achieve a desired power for a t-test.

## Normality Test

Two common tests for normality are the Shapiro-Wilk Test and the Kolmogorov-Smirnov Test.

## Two-Sample T-Test

This test investigates whether the means of two independent data samples differ from one another.

## Paired T-Test

This test compares the means of paired samples to determine if they differ.

## Type I and Type II Error

- **Type I Error**: Rejecting the null hypothesis when it is actually true.
- **Type II Error**: Failing to reject the null hypothesis when it is actually false.

## Statistical Power

Statistical power is the probability that a test correctly rejects the null hypothesis when it is actually false. It is influenced by the significance level, sample size, and effect size of the test.
